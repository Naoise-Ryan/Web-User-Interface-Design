                request and then retrives the data and sends it to the

                the information which is sent in small packets that the TCP breaks down and the IP helps guide the packets to its destination.

            <p>Frontend development is when someone develops the webpage that a user will actually see and interact with, it consists of using HTML5 
                HTML CSS and JavaScript. HTML is used to give a page structure, css is used to style things like color, spacing font etc and 
                javascript gives a page functionality
