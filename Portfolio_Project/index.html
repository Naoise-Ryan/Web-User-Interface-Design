                <h2>Rock, Paper, Scissors</h2>
                <p>This game was made mostly from scratch with just a basic project template for my first year class
                    games design.
                    <br><br>
                    The game was made in Visual studio using C++ and SFML, the sprites were made in Asperite.
                    <br><br>
                    This was my first ever game and is a rock, paper scissors game with 2 opponents and a secret
                    opponent, each opponent has different ai and every outcome has a unique animation.
